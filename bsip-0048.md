# Abstract

The possibility of creating assets on the BitShares Blockchain is a core feature
of our platform. In the case of an ICO, the ICO holders can create an asset with
a fixed maximum supply. However this maximum supply can be changed by the
asset creator (issuer) anytime. This exposes participants in the ICO to the risk
of losing value of their purchased asset.

With this BSIP a flag will be introduced which forbids the modification of the maximum
supply of an issuer created asset.

# Motivation

A flag to disable the modification of the maximum supply for 
issuer created asset will be implemented. This has benefits for both the participants and the ICO holder. Participants in the ICO are assured the value of their assets (tokens) will not be diluted by issuers creating more tokens. ICO holders are able to market the fact that the maximum supply is fixed.

# Rational

The `disable_modify_max_supply` is a newly created flag in the `asset_issuer_permissions`.
The flag can be activated to forbid the modification of the `max_supply` (`asset_object.options`).
Once the flag is set to `true`, it can only be set to `false` if `current_supply` is zero.

# Specifications

This BSIP comes with a change to the protocol, hence requires a propotocol upgrade.
However the changes to the code are minor.

1. Add the `disable_modify_max_supply` flag to the issuer permissions
2. Set `disable_modify_max_supply` to false for existing assets at hardfork time
3. Add a `can_modify_max_supply()` the `asset_object`
4. Change the `asset_update_evaluator::evaluate` method to assert false for
    1. the setting of the `disable_modify_max_supply` flag to `false` if `current_supply` is not zero or
    2. the modification of the `max_supply` when the `disable_modify_max_supply` is `true`
  
# Summary for Shareholders

This BSIP proposes a way to improve the financial security of users against the dilution of issuer created assets.
